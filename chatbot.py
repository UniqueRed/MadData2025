    You are an AI assistant that understands structured academic documents.
    Below is a university major requirement document extracted from a PDF:

    You have been provided with a CSV file containing detailed information about all available courses for a specific degree program. The CSV file includes columns such as:

    Subject,Course Name,Course Number,Total Class GPA,Professor Rating,graduation_score,admin_preference
    {csv_content}

    Your tasks are:

    Rank the Courses:
        Read the CSV data and rank all the available courses in descending order based on the Ranking Score.

    Generate a 4-Year Academic Plan:
        Using the ranked courses, create a comprehensive 4-year academic plan.
        Break down the plan by academic year (Years 1 through 4) and, if applicable, by semesters (e.g., Fall and Spring).
        Prioritize the inclusion of higher-ranked courses while ensuring that all prerequisite requirements are met (i.e., schedule prerequisite courses before or alongside courses that depend on them).
        Aim for a balanced course load across each term.
